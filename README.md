## WAV Audio Player

WAV files audio player with basic functions such as "play, next, back, add to queue" written on Java's Swing. 
Running a line listener in a separate thread, in order to be able to listen whether the playing track should be changed by itself or not, without stopping any of the other program's features. 

# features:
- choose directory
- add to queue (plays the first song in the queue after finishing the last one, or keeps repeating the song if there is only one)
- play/pause
- previous
- next

# Disclaimer!
Neither clear naming conventions, nor any consious OOP paradigms were applied in the production of this code (spaghetti code) :D. This was my first ever Java program
