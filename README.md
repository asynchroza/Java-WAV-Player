##WAV Audio Player with a simple interface

WAV files audio player with basic functions such as "play, next, back, add to queue" written on Java's Swing. 
Used a Line listener for the clip, which I am running in a new thread, in order to be able to listen for whether the playing track should be changed by itself or not, without stopping any of the other program's features.
